# a. Introduction to Godot

This article is here to help you figure out whether Godot might be a good fit for you. We will introduce some broad features of the engine to give you a feel for what you can achieve with it and answer questions such as "what do I need to know to get started?".

This is by no means an exhaustive overview. We will introduce many more features in this getting started series.

## What is Godot?

Godot is a general-purpose 2D and 3D game engine designed to support all sorts of projects. You can use it to create games or applications you can then release on desktop or mobile, as well as on the web.

You can also create console games with it, although you either need strong programming skills or a developer to port the game for you.

> [!Note]
> The Godot team can't provide an open-source console export due to the licensing terms imposed by console manufacturers. Regardless of the engine you use, though, releasing games on consoles is always a lot of work. You can read more on that here: [Console support in Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/platform/consoles.html#doc-consoles).

## What can the engine do?

Godot was initially developed in-house by an Argentinan game studio. Its development started in 2001, and the engine was rewritten and improved tremendously since its open-source release in 2014.

Some examples of games created with Godot include Ex-Zodiac and Helms of Fury.

![../../_images/introduction_ex_zodiac.png||400](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/introduction_ex_zodiac.png) ![../../_images/introduction_helms_of_fury.jpg||400](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/introduction_helms_of_fury.jpg)

As for applications, the open-source pixel art drawing program Pixelorama is powered by Godot, and so is the voxel RPG creator RPG in a box.

![../../_images/introduction_rpg_in_a_box.png||550](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/introduction_rpg_in_a_box.png)

You can find many more examples in the [official showcase videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeG_dAglpVo6EpaO9A1nkwJZOwrfiLdQ8).

## How does it work and look?

Godot comes with a fully-fledged game editor with integrated tools to answer the most common needs. It includes a code editor, an animation editor, a tilemap editor, a shader editor, a debugger, a profiler, and more.

![../../_images/introduction_editor.png||550](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/introduction_editor.png)

The team strives to offer a feature-rich game editor with a consistent user experience. While there is always room for improvement, the user interface keeps getting refined.

Of course, if you prefer, you can work with external programs. We officially support importing 3D scenes designed in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and maintain plugins to code in [VSCode](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-vscode-plugin) and [Emacs](https://github.com/godotengine/emacs-gdscript-mode) for GDScript and C#. We also support Visual Studio for C# on Windows.

![../../_images/introduction_vscode.png||550](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/introduction_vscode.png)

## Programming languages

Let's talk about the available programming languages.

You can code your games using [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/index.html#toc-learn-scripting-gdscript), a Godot-specific and tightly integrated language with a lightweight syntax, or [C#](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/index.html#toc-learn-scripting-c), which is popular in the games industry. These are the two main scripting languages we support.

Godot also supports a node-based visual programming language named [VisualScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/visual_script/index.html#toc-learn-scripting-visual-script).

With the [GDNative](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdnative/index.html#toc-tutorials-gdnative) technology, you can also write gameplay or high-performance algorithms in C or C++ without recompiling the engine. You can use this technology to integrate third-party libraries and other Software Development Kits (SDK) in the engine.

Of course, you can also directly add modules and features to the engine, as it's completely free and open-source.

> [!See also]
> These are the five officially supported programming languages. The community maintains support for many more. For more information, see [GDNative third-party bindings](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdnative/what_is_gdnative.html#doc-what-is-gdnative-third-party-bindings).

## What do I need to know to use Godot?

Godot is a feature-packed game engine. With its thousands of features, there is a lot to learn. To make the most of it, you need good programming foundations. While we try to make the engine accessible, you will benefit a lot from knowing how to think like a programmer first.

In the next part, we'll show you a free and open-source app you can use to learn the basics of programming with Godot's GDScript programming language.

# b. Learn to code with GDScript

In Godot, you can write code using the GDScript and C# programming languages.

If you are new to programming, we recommend starting with GDScript because we designed it to be simpler than all-purpose languages like C#. It will be both faster and easier to learn.

While GDScript is a language specific to Godot, the techniques you will learn with it will apply to other programming languages.

Note that it is completely normal for a programmer to learn and use multiple languages. Programming languages have more similarities than differences, so once you know one, you can learn another much faster.

## Learn in your browser with the GDScript app

To learn GDScript, you can use the app Learn GDScript From Zero. It is a complete beginner course with interactive practices you can do right in your browser.

![../../_images/learn_gdscript_app.png||550](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/learn_gdscript_app.png)

Click here to access the app: [Learn GDScript From Zero app](https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript/?ref=godot-docs)

This app is an open-source project. To report bugs or contribute, head to the app's source code repository: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GDQuest/learn-gdscript).

In the next part, you will get an overview of the engine's essential concepts.

# c. Overview of Godot's key concepts

Every game engine revolves around abstractions you use to build your applications. In Godot, a game is a **tree** of **nodes** that you group together into **scenes**. You can then wire these nodes so they can communicate using **signals**.

These are the four concepts you will learn here. We're going to look at them briefly to give you a sense of how the engine works. In the getting started series, you will get to use them in practice.

## Scenes

In Godot, you break down your game in reusable scenes. A scene can be a character, a weapon, a menu in the user interface, a single house, an entire level, or anything you can think of. Godot's scenes are flexible; they fill the role of both prefabs and scenes in some other game engines.

![../../_images/key_concepts_main_menu.png||550](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/key_concepts_main_menu.png)

You can also nest scenes. For example, you can put your character in a level, and drag and drop a scene as a child of it.

![../../_images/key_concepts_scene_example.png||400](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/key_concepts_scene_example.png)

## Nodes

A scene is composed of one or more **nodes**. Nodes are your game's smallest building blocks that you arrange into trees. Here's an example of a character's nodes.

![../../_images/key_concepts_character_nodes.png||400](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/key_concepts_character_nodes.png)

It is made of a `KinematicBody2D` node named "Character", a `Sprite`, a `Camera2D`, and a `CollisionShape2D`.

> [!Note]
> The node names end with "2D" because this is a 2D scene. Their 3D counterpart have names that end with "3D".

Notice how nodes and scenes look the same in the editor. When you save a tree of nodes as a scene, it then shows as a single node, with its internal structure hidden in the editor.

Godot provides an extensive library of base node types you can combine and extend to build more powerful ones. 2D, 3D, or user interface, you will do most things with these nodes.

![../../_images/key_concepts_node_menu.png||400](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/key_concepts_node_menu.png)

## The scene tree

All your game's scenes come together in the **scene tree**, literally a tree of scenes. And as scenes are trees of nodes, the scene tree also is a tree of nodes. But it's easier to think of your game in terms of scenes as they can represent characters, weapons, doors, or your user interface.

![../../_images/key_concepts_scene_tree.png||250](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/key_concepts_scene_tree.png)

## Signals

Nodes emit signals when some event occurs. This feature allows you to make nodes communicate without hard-wiring them in code. It gives you a lot of flexibility in how you structure your scenes.

![../../_images/key_concepts_signals.png||300](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/key_concepts_signals.png)

> [!Note]
> Signals are Godot's version of the _observer_ pattern. You can read more about it here: [https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html)

For example, buttons emit a signal when pressed. You can connect to this signal to run code in reaction to this event, like starting the game or opening a menu.

Other built-in signals can tell you when two objects collided, when a character or monster entered a given area, and much more. You can also define new signals tailored to your game.

## Summary

Nodes, scenes, the scene tree, and signals are four core concepts in Godot that you will manipulate all the time.

Nodes are your game's smallest building blocks. You combine them to create scenes that you then combine and nest into the scene tree. You can then use signals to make nodes react to events in other nodes or different scene tree branches.

After this short breakdown, you probably have many questions. Bear with us as you will get many answers throughout the getting started series.

# d. First look at Godot's editor

This page will give you a brief overview of Godot's interface. We're going to look at the different main screens and docks to help you situate yourself.

> [!info]
> For a comprehensive breakdown of the editor's interface and how to use it, see the [Editor manual](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/editor/index.html#toc-learn-editor).

## The Project manager

When you launch Godot, the first window you see is the Project Manager. In the default tab, "Projects," you can manage existing projects, import or create new ones, and more.

![../../_images/editor_intro_project_manager.png||450](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_project_manager.png)

At the top of the window, there is another tab named "Asset Library Projects". In the open-source asset library you can search for demo projects, templates, and completed projects, including many that are developed by the community.

![../../_images/editor_intro_project_templates.png||400](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_project_templates.png)

You can also change the editor's language using the drop-down menu to the right of the engine's version in the window's top-right corner. By default, it is in English (EN).

![../../_images/editor_intro_language.png](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_language.png)

## First look at Godot's editor

When you open a new or an existing project, the editor's interface appears. Let's look at its main areas.

![../../_images/editor_intro_editor_empty.png||400](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_editor_empty.png)

By default, it features **menus**, **main screens**, and playtest buttons along the window's top edge.

![../../_images/editor_intro_top_menus.png](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_top_menus.png)

In the center is the **viewport** with its **toolbar** at the top, where you'll find tools to move, scale, or lock the scene's nodes.

![../../_images/editor_intro_3d_viewport.png||400](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_3d_viewport.png)

On either side of the viewport sit the **docks**. And at the bottom of the window lies the **bottom panel**.

The toolbar changes based on the context and selected node. Here is the 2D toolbar.

![../../_images/editor_intro_toolbar_2d.png](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_toolbar_2d.png)

Below is the 3D one.

![../../_images/editor_intro_toolbar_3d.png](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_toolbar_3d.png)

Let's look at the docks. The **FileSystem** dock lists your project files, be it scripts, images, audio samples, and more.

![../../_images/editor_intro_filesystem_dock.png||200](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_filesystem_dock.png)

The **Scene** dock lists the active scene's nodes.

![../../_images/editor_intro_scene_dock.png||200](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_scene_dock.png)

The **Inspector** allows you to edit the properties of a selected node.

![../../_images/editor_intro_inspector_dock.png||200](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_inspector_dock.png)

The **bottom panel**, situated below the viewport, is the host for the debug console, the animation editor, the audio mixer, and more. They can take precious space, that's why they're folded by default.

![../../_images/editor_intro_bottom_panels.png](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_bottom_panels.png)

When you click on one, it expands vertically. Below, you can see the animation editor opened.

![../../_images/editor_intro_bottom_panel_animation.png||400](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_bottom_panel_animation.png)

## The four main screens

There are four main screen buttons centered at the top of the editor: 2D, 3D, Script, and AssetLib.

You'll use the **2D screen** for all types of games. In addition to 2D games, the 2D screen is where you'll build your interfaces.

![../../_images/editor_intro_workspace_2d.png||500](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_workspace_2d.png)

In the **3D screen**, you can work with meshes, lights, and design levels for 3D games.

![../../_images/editor_intro_workspace_3d.png||500](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_workspace_3d.png)

Notice the perspective button under the toolbar. Clicking on it opens a list of options related to the 3D view.

![../../_images/editor_intro_3d_viewport_perspective.png||300](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_3d_viewport_perspective.png)

> [!Note]
> Read [Introduction to 3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/3d/introduction_to_3d.html#doc-introduction-to-3d) for more detail about the **3D main screen**.

The **Script screen** is a complete code editor with a debugger, rich auto-completion, and built-in code reference.

![../../_images/editor_intro_workspace_script.png||500](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_workspace_script.png)

Finally, the **AssetLib** is a library of free and open-source add-ons, scripts, and assets to use in your projects.

![../../_images/editor_intro_workspace_assetlib.png||500](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_workspace_assetlib.png)

> [!info]
>You can learn more about the asset library in [About the Asset Library](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/asset_library/what_is_assetlib.html#doc-what-is-assetlib).

## Integrated class reference

Godot comes with a built-in class reference.

You can search for information about a class, method, property, constant, or signal by any one of the following methods:

-   Pressing F1 (or Alt + Space on macOS) anywhere in the editor.
-   Clicking the "Search Help" button in the top-right of the Script main screen.
-   Clicking on the Help menu and Search Help.
-   Clicking while pressing the Ctrl key on a class name, function name, or built-in variable in the script editor.

![../../_images/editor_intro_search_help_button.png||500](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_search_help_button.png)

When you do any of these, a window pops up. Type to search for any item. You can also use it to browse available objects and methods.

![../../_images/editor_intro_search_help.png||500](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_search_help.png)

Double-click on an item to open the corresponding page in the script main screen.

![../../_images/editor_intro_help_class_animated_sprite.png||500](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/editor_intro_help_class_animated_sprite.png)

# e. Learning new features

Godot is a feature-rich game engine. There is a lot to learn about it. This page explains how you can use the online manual, built-in code reference, and join online communities to learn new features and techniques.

## Making the most of this manual

What you are reading now is the user manual. It documents each of the engine's concepts and available features. When learning a new topic, you can start by browsing the corresponding section of this website. The left menu allows you to explore broad topics while the search bar will help you find more specific pages. If a page exists for a given theme, it will often link to more related content.

![../../_images/manual_search.png||200](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/manual_search.png)

The manual has a companion class reference that explains each Godot class's available functions and properties when programming. While the manual covers general features, concepts, and how to use the editor, the reference is all about using Godot's scripting API (Application Programming Interface). You can access it both online and offline. We recommend browsing the reference offline, from within the Godot editor. To do so, go to Help -> Search or press F1.

![../../_images/manual_class_reference_search.png||400](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/manual_class_reference_search.png)

To browse it online, head to the manual's [Class Reference](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/index.html#toc-class-ref) section.

A class reference's page tells you:

1.  Where the class exists in the inheritance hierarchy. You can click the top links to jump to parent classes and see the properties and methods a type inherits.
    ![../../_images/manual_class_reference_inheritance.png||400](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/manual_class_reference_inheritance.png)
2.  A summary of the class's role and use cases.
3.  An explanation of the class's properties, methods, signals, enums, and constants.
4.  Links to manual pages further detailing the class.
    
> [!Note]
> If the manual or class reference is missing or has insufficient information, please open an Issue in the official [godot-docs](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/issues) GitHub repository to report it.
> You can Ctrl-click any underlined text like the name of a class, property, method, signal, or constant to jump to it.

## Learning with the community

Godot has a growing community of users. If you're stuck on a problem or need help to better understand how to achieve something, you can ask other users for help on one of the many [active communities](https://godotengine.org/community).

The best place to ask for questions and find already answered ones is the official [Questions & Answers](https://godotengine.org/qa/) site. These responses show up in search engine results and get saved, allowing other users to benefit from discussions on the platform. Once you asked a question there, you can share its link on other social platforms. Before asking a question, be sure to look for existing answers that might solve your problem on this website or using your preferred search engine.

Asking questions well and providing details will help others answer you faster and better. When asking questions, we recommend including the following information:

1.  **Describe your goal**. You want to explain what you are trying to achieve design-wise. If you are having trouble figuring out how to make a solution work, there may be a different, easier solution that accomplishes the same goal.
    
2.  If there is an error involved, **share the exact error message**. You can copy the exact error message in the editor's Debugger bottom panel by clicking the Copy Error icon. Knowing what it says can help community members better identify how you triggered the error.
    
3.  If there is code involved, **share a code sample**. Other users won't be able to help you fix a problem without seeing your code. Share the code as text directly. To do so, you can copy and paste a short code snippet in a chat box, or use a website like [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) to share long files.
    
4.  **Share a screenshot** of your _Scene_ dock along with your written code. Most of the code you write affects nodes in your scenes. As a result, you should think of those scenes as part of your source code.
    
    ![../../_images/key_concepts_scene_tree.png||250](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/key_concepts_scene_tree.png)
    
    Also, please don't take a picture with your phone, the low quality and screen reflections can make it hard to understand the image. Your operating system should have a built-in tool to take screenshots with the PrtSc (Print Screen) key.
    
    Alternatively, you can use a program like [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) on Windows or [FlameShot](https://flameshot.org/) on Linux.
    
5.  Sharing a video of your running game can also be really **useful to troubleshoot your game**. You can use programs like [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) and [Screen to GIF](https://www.screentogif.com/) to capture your screen.
    
    You can then use a service like [streamable](https://streamable.com/) or a cloud provider to upload and share your videos for free.
    
6.  If you're not using the stable version of Godot, please mention the version you're using. The answer can be different as available features and the interface evolve rapidly.
    

Following these guidelines will maximize your chances of getting the answer you're looking for. They will save time both to you and the persons helping you.

## Community tutorials

This manual aims to provide a comprehensive reference of Godot's features. Aside from the 2D and 3D getting started series, it does not contain tutorials to implement specific game genres. If you're looking for a tutorial about creating a role-playing game, a platformer, or other, please see [Tutorials and resources](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/tutorials.html#doc-community-tutorials), which lists content made by the Godot community.

# f. Godot's design philosophy

Now that you've gotten your feet wet, let's talk about Godot's design.

**Every game engine is different and fits different needs.** Not only do they offer a range of features, but the design of each engine is unique. This leads to different workflows and different ways to form your games' structures. This all stems from their respective design philosophies.

This page is here to help you understand how Godot works, starting with some of its core pillars. It is not a list of available features, nor is it an engine comparison. To know if any engine can be a good fit for your project, you need to try it out for yourself and understand its design and limitations.

Please watch [Godot explained in 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjX5llYZ5eQ) if you're looking for an overview of the engine's features.

## Object-oriented design and composition

Godot embraces object-oriented design at its core with its flexible scene system and Node hierarchy. It tries to stay away from strict programming patterns to offer an intuitive way to structure your game.

For one, Godot lets you **compose or aggregate** scenes. It's like nested prefabs: you can create a BlinkingLight scene and a BrokenLantern scene that uses the BlinkingLight. Then, create a city filled with BrokenLanterns. Change the BlinkingLight's color, save, and all the BrokenLanterns in the city will update instantly.

On top of that, you can **inherit** from any scene.

A Godot scene could be a Weapon, a Character, an Item, a Door, a Level, part of a level… anything you'd like. It works like a class in pure code, except you're free to design it by using the editor, using only the code, or mixing and matching the two.

It's different from prefabs you find in several 3D engines, as you can then inherit from and extend those scenes. You may create a Magician that extends your Character. Modify the Character in the editor and the Magician will update as well. It helps you build your projects so that their structure matches the game's design.

![image0||400](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/engine_design_01.png)

Also note that Godot offers many different types of objects called nodes, each with a specific purpose. Nodes are part of a tree and always inherit from their parents up to the Node class. Although the engine does feature some nodes like collision shapes that a parent physics body will use, most nodes work independently from one another.

In other words, Godot's nodes do not work like components in some other game engines.

![image1||200](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/engine_design_02.png)

Sprite is a Node2D, a CanvasItem and a Node. It has all the properties and features of its three parent classes, like transforms or the ability to draw custom shapes and render with a custom shader.

## All-inclusive package

Godot tries to provide its own tools to answer most common needs. It has a dedicated scripting workspace, an animation editor, a tilemap editor, a shader editor, a debugger, a profiler, the ability to hot-reload locally and on remote devices, etc.

![image2||500](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/engine_design_03.png)

The goal is to offer a full package to create games and a continuous user experience. You can still work with external programs as long as there is an import plugin for it. Or you can create one, like the [Tiled Map Importer](https://github.com/vnen/godot-tiled-importer).

That is also partly why Godot offers its own programming languages GDScript and VisualScript, along with C#. They're designed for the needs of game developers and game designers, and they're tightly integrated in the engine and the editor.

GDScript lets you write code using an indentation-based syntax, yet it detects types and offers a static language's quality of auto-completion. It is also optimized for gameplay code with built-in types like Vectors and Colors.

Note that with GDNative, you can write high-performance code using compiled languages like C, C++, Rust, or Python (using the Cython compiler) without recompiling the engine.

![image3||500](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/engine_design_visual_script.png)

_VisualScript is a node-based programming language that integrates well in the editor. You can drag and drop nodes or resources into the graph to create new code blocks._

Note that the 3D workspace doesn't feature as many tools as the 2D workspace. You'll need external programs or add-ons to edit terrains, animate complex characters, and so on. Godot provides a complete API to extend the editor's functionality using game code. See [The Godot editor is a Godot game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/godot_design_philosophy.html#the-godot-editor-is-a-godot-game) below.

![image4||500](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/engine_design_fsm_plugin.png)

_A State Machine editor plugin in Godot 2 by kubecz3k. It lets you manage states and transitions visually._

> [!Warning]
> [Godot 4.0 will remove VisualScript from core entirely.](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-will-discontinue-visual-scripting) As a result, creating new projects using visual scripting in Godot is not recommended. Future Godot 4.x releases may have VisualScript reimplemented as an extension.
> While Godot 3.x will keep VisualScript supported, we recommend [trying out GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/index.html#toc-learn-scripting-gdscript) instead, especially if you intend to migrate your project to Godot 4.

## Open source

Godot offers a fully open source codebase under the **MIT license**. This means all the technologies that ship with it have to be Free (as in freedom) as well. For the most part, they're developed from the ground up by contributors.

Anyone can plug in proprietary tools for the needs of their projects — they just won't ship with the engine. This may include Google AdMob, or FMOD. Any of these can come as third-party plugins instead.

On the other hand, an open codebase means you can **learn from and extend the engine** to your heart's content. You can also debug games easily, as Godot will print errors with a stack trace, even if they come from the engine itself.

> [!Note]
> This **does not affect the work you do with Godot** in any way: there's no strings attached to the engine or anything you make with it.

## Community-driven

**Godot is made by its community, for the community, and for all game creators out there.** It's the needs of the users and open discussions that drive the core updates. New features from the core developers often focus on what will benefit the most users first.

That said, although a handful of core developers work on it full-time, the project has over 600 contributors at the time of writing. Benevolent programmers work on features they may need themselves, so you'll see improvements in all corners of the engine at the same time in every major release.

## The Godot editor is a Godot game

The Godot editor runs on the game engine. It uses the engine's own UI system, it can hot-reload code and scenes when you test your projects, or run game code in the editor. This means you can **use the same code** and scenes for your games, or **build plugins and extend the editor.**

This leads to a reliable and flexible UI system, as it powers the editor itself. With the `tool` keyword, you can run any game code in the editor.

_RPG in a Box is a voxel RPG editor made with Godot 2. It uses Godot's UI tools for its node-based programming system and for the rest of the interface._

Put the `tool` keyword at the top of any GDScript file and it will run in the editor. This lets you import and export plugins, create plugins like custom level editors, or create scripts with the same nodes and API you use in your projects.

> [!Note]
> The editor is fully written in C++ and is statically compiled into the binary. This means you can't import it as a typical project that would have a `project.godot` file.

## Separate 2D and 3D engines

Godot offers dedicated 2D and 3D rendering engines. As a result, **the base unit for 2D scenes is pixels.** Even though the engines are separate, you can render 2D in 3D, 3D in 2D, and overlay 2D sprites and interfaces over your 3D world.
